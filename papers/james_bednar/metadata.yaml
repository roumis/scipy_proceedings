abstract:
   - Are you held back by your scientific domainâ€™s legacy tools for reading, processing, plotting, analyzing, modeling, or exploring data? Consider building on dask, xarray, numba, hvplot, jupyter, and other modern domain-independent libraries from the SOSA stack for scalable open-source analysis. SOSA lets you run nearly any scientific data-processing workflow at machine-code speeds from laptops to petaflop-scale supercomputers. We'll show how these libraries work together to support distributed computation all the way from data files up to a final rendered visualization, making it as simple to work with remote cloud clusters as on your own local machine.
